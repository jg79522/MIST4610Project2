## Data Set Overview:
The dataset used comes from the Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity section of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) published by the CDC. The information was obtained [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nutrition-physical-activity-and-obesity-behavioral-risk-factor-surveillance-system). The data contains 106,260 rows and 33 columns, with rows representing population-level estimates for specific demographic subgroups within each state and year. Subgroup categories include Age (years), Sex, Race/Ethnicity, Education, and Income. The field Question describes which health indicator is being measured (“Percent of adults aged 18 years and older who have obesity” for our analysis), and the field Data Value provides the aforementioned population estimate as a percentage.

## Manipulations Applied:
No direct data manipulations were performed. The dataset is already standardized and represents population-level estimates by location and time according to the subsets of stratifications and questions. Additionally, it was already properly formatted with data values representing percentages. The only adjustments made were basic filtering to isolate specific measures in order to answer the relevant questions and better display the information.
